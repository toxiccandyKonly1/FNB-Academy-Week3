# FNB-Academy-Week3
🌿 Week 3 project for FNB App Academy: A responsive multi-page web app for Pine City Zoo, featuring animal info, attractions, weather updates, and a feedback form. Built with HTML &amp; CSS, focusing on UX/UI design and semantic structure.

🎉 Welcome to the Pine City Zoo Guide App! 🦓🦜🌦

🌟 About the Project
Ever dreamed of a digital safari from your browser? This web app was crafted during Week 3 of the FNB App Academy adventure — your pocket-sized tour guide to the Pine City Zoo. No animal droppings, just clean HTML and CSS!

🚀 Features That Roar
🐘 Animals Page – Meet the residents, from majestic elephants to cheeky meerkats

🗺️ Places Page – Discover key attractions across the zoo grounds

☁️ Weather Page – Because even the penguins like to know the forecast

💬 Feedback Form – Tell us if you loved it… or if your favorite animal was missing

🏠 Home Page – Start your journey with a warm welcome and great layout

🎨 Tech Stack
HTML5 – Building blocks of the web

CSS3 – Styling so smooth, even the flamingos are impressed

UX/UI Concepts – Organized layout, intuitive design, zebra-approved aesthetics

🤓 What I Learned
Semantic HTML is like giving every tag its own name badge

CSS grids > herding cats (seriously)

Linking pages = connecting worlds

📦 How to Explore
Clone the repo, open index.html, and start exploring the zoo from your browser. No boots or bug spray required.

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zoo-week3
🐾 Final Roar
This app isn't just a project — it's proof that learning can be wild, creative, and downright fun. Built with curiosity, caffeine, and a dash of developer magic.
